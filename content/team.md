Scott Sinclair grew up deeply involved with computers and then, pulling a 180, decided to get a bachelorâ€™s degree in English.  This was a mistake that he corrected over the course of the Covid lockdowns by enrolling in the Camosun ICS program.  There he studied many different languages such as Python, JavaScript, C++, and Java.  He has since decided on a permanent career path in technology.  In the future, he hopes to help develop the first true artificial intelligence and advance humanity into a golden age beyond the stars.
