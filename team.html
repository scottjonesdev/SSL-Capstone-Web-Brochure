Scott Jones first became interested in computers and technology to record his music.  Drawn to the intersection between creativity and technology, he decided to enroll in the IMD program at Camosun College.  At Camosun, Scott has studied a variety of subjects including Web Development, UX Design, Digital Art, Game Development, and Mobile Application Development; he has since developed a deep passion for programming and design.  A hard worker and problem solver, Scott is looking forward to new opportunities post-graduation.

Scott Sinclair grew up deeply involved with computers and then, pulling a 180, decided to get a bachelor’s degree in English.  This was a mistake that he corrected over the course of the Covid lockdowns by enrolling in the Camosun ICS program.  There he studied many different languages such as Python, JavaScript, C++, and Java.  He has since decided on a permanent career path in technology.  In the future, he hopes to help develop the first true artificial intelligence and advance humanity into a golden age beyond the stars.

Lawrence Bierworth has always had an interest in technology, problem solving, and design.  He is in the process of changing careers after serving in the Canadian Forces for twelve years.  His strengths at Camosun have been organization, documentation, communication, both written and verbal, and agility when facing challenges.  Lawrence brings both the skills he has gained in ICS, and those learned in the military, such as presentation, reporting, analytical skills, and teamwork with a strong mission-first focus.
